# Boring Browser Co.

A browser. It browses the web.

## What is this?

This is a browser. You type URLs. It shows websites. Revolutionary stuff.

We got tired of browsers that do 47 different things poorly, so we made one that does 1 thing adequately.

## Why does this exist?

Because every other browser is either:

- Stealing your data
- Showing you ads
- Trying to be your best friend
- Pretending to care about your "journey"

We don't care about your journey. We care about browsing websites.

## Features

- Browses websites ✓
- Has an address bar ✓
- Shows web pages ✓
- Doesn't spy on you ✓
- Lets you pick colors ✓
- That's it ✓

## Installation

1. Download the thing
1. Run the thing
1. Use the thing

No, we won't hold your hand through this process.

## Requirements

- A computer
- Eyes (optional but recommended)
- Basic understanding of what a browser is
- Willingness to use software made by people who think corporate UX is trash

## Security

We collect zero data. Not "anonymized" data. Not "essential" data. Zero data.

Your browsing habits are none of our business. We literally cannot see what you do because we didn't build any way to see it.

## Customization

You can:

- Change colors (wow)
- Upload your own logo (amazing)
- Pick your street artist tag (revolutionary)

You cannot:

- Make it play music
- Turn it into a social media app
- Add seventeen different sidebar widgets
- Transform it into something it's not

## Support

There is no support. Figure it out.

If something is broken, fix it yourself or submit a pull request. We're not your tech support.

## Contributing

Sure, whatever. Follow these rules:

1. Don't make it complicated
1. Don't add tracking
1. Don't make it "fun" or "engaging"
1. Keep the personality dry and honest
1. No corporate speak allowed

## License

MIT License because we're not control freaks.

Use this code to build whatever you want. Start your own Boring Company if that's your thing.

## Philosophy

Most software treats you like an idiot who needs guidance, gamification, and constant positive reinforcement.

We treat you like an adult who knows what they want: a browser that browses websites without any bullshit.
