## ▓▒░ WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? ░▒▓

A browser that doesn't want to be your friend.

Corporate browsers spy on you. We don't.  
Corporate browsers sell ads. We don't sell anything.  
Corporate browsers have "user engagement metrics." We have principles.

## ▓▒░ INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ░▒▓

```bash
# Step 1: Download the thing
curl -L https://github.com/boring-browser/releases/latest

# Step 2: Run the thing  
./boring-browser

# Step 3: Browse the web like a human being
# (No further instructions needed)
```

**WARNING:** This software may cause allergic reactions in people who enjoy being tracked.

## ▓▒░ SECURITY MODEL ░▒▓

```
DATA_COLLECTED = 0
TRACKERS_BLOCKED = ∞
CORPORATE_PARTNERSHIPS = null
PRIVACY_VIOLATIONS = undefined
YOUR_BUSINESS = your_business
```

We literally cannot see what you browse because we didn't build the infrastructure to spy on you.

This is called "privacy by design" but we call it "not being assholes."

## ▓▒░ PHILOSOPHY ░▒▓

Most browsers treat you like:

- A product to be sold
- A child who needs guidance
- A data point in their growth metrics
- An engagement number

We treat you like:

- A human being with agency
- Someone who knows what they want
- A person who values their privacy
- An adult who can figure shit out
